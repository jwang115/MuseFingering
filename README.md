# MuseFingering
A plugin in MuseScore you can use to automatically generate fingerings for sheet music

Personally as I was learning pieces on my own, I had tremendous difficulty (and still currently) coming up with fingerings for a piece.  The goal for this plugin is to create fingerings basic enough for students to use to learn a piece.  Ideally, there should be little editing/changing of the fingerings hopefully after the program runs.

The motivation to use MuseScore came because it is a free scorewriter software available recommended for Windows, macOS, and Linux.  This is in comparison to more expensive brands like Sibelius and Finale.  The ultimate goal, however, is to use this plugin in Sibelius and Finale because of their more prevalent useage in the music industry.

This project is still in progress as of December 2018 and I welcome all sorts of feedback.
